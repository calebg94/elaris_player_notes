# Session Overview

Made it to The Hollowed Hearth and met Arjhan. Accepted quest to remove harpies for Arjhan and recieve 15 dragon coins, a map fragment, and the opportunity to view the cellar. During the movement to the harpies they met and  befriended a hippogriff named Gus the Griff. During the battle with the Harpies, Gus was blinded. Nyx and Missa are determined to cure Gus of his wounds and allow him to see and fly again. The players defeated the harpies and brought their heads back to Arjhan as confirmation. Arjhan provided the players with their reward and we ended just before going into the cellar.
