### Quest Narrative
A deep mist curls around Nyx’s feet as the air thickens like sap. Every step forward is muffled. The earth is soft beneath her boots. The trees here don’t sway, and the leaves above are stuck mid-motion, frozen like a moment of breath never exhaled.  
The birdsong is gone. There is no life here. Only silence... and the sound of her own heartbeat.  
Until she hears a whisper—not with her ears, but in her soul.  
  
“You spoke for us. You commanded us. But did you listen?”

Nyx passes familiar trees—landmarks from her homeland—but they are **twisted, bark cracked and hollow, their roots pulled from the ground like veins**. Pools of black water bubble where rivers once flowed. Mushrooms twitch in the corners of her vision.

Then she sees it.

A once-beautiful elk-like beast she once healed shuffles toward her:

- **Milky eyes**, long gone blind.
    
- **Fungal ridges** down its spine.
    
- Its body a mix of fur, bark, and **corruption**, laced with purple veins and lichen.
    
- It’s **not hostile**… but it is **suffering**.
    

The **forest murmurs**, with hundreds of tiny voices rustling through unmoving leaves:

> “You did this.” “You broke balance.” “You vowed to protect the world. But who protects the world from you?”

Let Nyx **describe her reaction first**—does she cry, retreat, whisper Druidic? Then guide her through one of the following paths:

### Encounter Options
##### **Option 1: Restore It** (Compassion and Redemption)

Nyx kneels, ignoring the rot and the flies. She lays a hand on the creature’s flank, softly humming a **Druidic prayer**. Her magic does not seek control—but healing.

> The creature twitches, uncertain. Then slowly calms. As her magic flows, patches of green return to its bark. One eye clears. Flowers bloom around its legs. It **breathes**, and for a moment, looks at her with recognition.

**Mechanics:**

- Cast _Cure Wounds_, _Lesser Restoration_, or _Druidcraft_ meaningfully.
    
- Or roll **DC 16 Wisdom (Nature)** to commune with the creature's spirit.
    

**Reward**:

- Gift of the Greenheart: Gains **advantage on Nature and Animal Handling checks**, 1/long rest
    
- She feels renewed. Her vision has meaning again.
    

##### **Option 2: Release It** (Acceptance and Letting Go)

Nyx kneels and places her forehead against the beast’s. It trembles, and she whispers a farewell—not of dominance, but release.

> Ask what she says or read the prompt:
> “You are part of the forest now,” she says. “You always were.”

The creature stands and bows. It turns. Walks into the mist. As it passes, **tiny blue flowers bloom** in its wake. It does not look back.

**Outcome**:

- Gains **inspiration** and a feeling of spiritual balance.
    
- Verdant protection: A **spectral version of the creature** will appear during the **final boss fight**, giving her **1 auto-success** on a failed saving throw (chosen by DM) .
    

##### **Option 3: End Its Suffering** (Mercy Through Strength)

Her eyes harden. Her grip tightens. One clean blow. One spell, quick and precise.

> The creature doesn’t resist. It slumps over gently as attack ends its pain. The forest around her grows still. The judgment fades—not in approval, but in resignation.

- **Outcome**:
    
    - Gains **resistance to necrotic damage** until the next long rest.
        
    - But the next time she tries to **speak to or summon an animal**, it **hesitates** or **refuses**, sensing something broken (DC 16 animal handling check).
        

**DM Prompt:**

> “You chose peace through death. But peace has a price. The wild watches—and it remembers.”

##### **Failure State: Indecision or Panic**

If Nyx turns away, screams, or hesitates too long, the creature’s **suffering turns to panic**.

> It lashes out—not physically, but psychically. Its scream warps the air. The ground pulses with grief. The forest becomes a mouth—open and howling.

**Mechanics:**

- **DC 14 Dexterity Save**
    
    - Fail: Take **3d8 psychic damage**.
        
    - Success: Take half damage.
        

**Flavor:**

> The vines wrap her arms. The spores invade her mind. The voices hiss:  
> “You vowed to protect us. So why won’t you act?”

##### Additional Detail:

As the trial ends, the trees part, revealing a radiant opening in the woods—the exit from the fog.

- If she succeeded with compassion or sacrifice, **new growth** trails behind her footsteps.
    
- If she failed or chose violence, **fungal spores** drift from her cloak as she walks—subtle, but lingering.
