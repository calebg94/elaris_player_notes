### Quest Narrative
The sound of wind through the leaves becomes **screams**.

The scent of ash. Burned pine. Oil.

Then—your mother’s voice, distant. Your father’s roar—cut short.

You stand in your village. The flames reach high, licking the sky. But this time… you're not a boy behind the smoke.  
You're a man with a blade. And you remember what comes next.

Your father, **Ragnar**, swings his axe—**and misses**. A bandit's blade pierces his side. He drops to his knees. Your mother runs to him, but her scream is swallowed by the blaze.

And then you see him.

A rider, descending the hill. Banner of Torm tattered. Armor cracked. The legendary **Paladin Rael**—the one who saved your village, the one who gave you your path.

But now… he only watches.

His voice reaches you not in salvation, but in sorrow.

> **"Thorin... if I had not come, what would you be?"**  
> **"Do you serve justice... or just a memory?"**  
> **"What would you become if no one came to save you again?"**

The world fractures like glass. Flames twist into spears. Your village becomes a temple. Then a grave.  
Rael’s form changes—your father’s face, your own reflection, and finally: a man whose eyes burn like molten chains.

> **"You call it faith. I call it fire. And you’ve carried it… blindly."**

### Encounter Options
##### **Stand with the Fallen

> You do not run. You do not question.  
> You raise your shield—not at Rael—but beside your father’s broken form.  
> You know the fire may come again. You know no one may save you.  
> But still—you stand.

**Check:** DC 15 Constitution **or** Athletics check  
**On Success:**
- You endure the onslaught of burning memories.
    
- The warped battlefield slows. The fire does not touch you.
    
- You see your father look to you—not as a boy, but as a shield.
    

**On Failure:**
- You are struck by a falling beam or phantom weapon: **take 1d4 psychic damage**
    
- Roll the test again with advantage as the vision pushes harder.
    

**Reward:**

- Gain **Inspiration**
    
- Gain **Resistance to Fear** until next long rest
    
- A voice echoes—faint, warm:
> _“Courage is not found in the flame… but in the shadow it casts.”_
    

#### **Confront Rael’s Voice**

> You walk forward. The illusion of Rael looms like a titan.  
> But your voice is steady:  
> Prompt Bryan or read below:
> _“You weren’t the answer. You were just the spark. I carry the fire now. I choose what it means.”_

**Check:** DC 15 **Insight** or **Charisma (Persuasion)** check  
**On Success:**
- The illusion cracks. Rael shudders, then fractures into flame.
    
- Beneath him, the **sigil of Torm twists into a spiral**—half divine, half unknown.
    

**Reward:**
- Immovable Mind: Gain **Immunity to Mind Manipulation** for 1 hour, 1/long rest
    
- You now carry clarity mixed with doubt. You sense **Rael was not alone** in that moment. Something _else_ guided his arrival.

#### **Walk Alone into the Fire**

>You do not fight.  
> You do not answer.  
> You walk into the fire as your village burns anew.  
> Alone. Accepting that your strength is not owed to a god… but to your resolve.

**Check:** DC 15 **Wisdom Saving Throw**

**On Success:**
- The fire **does not burn**. It wraps around you like silk.
    
- You see the outline of your younger self… vanish into the smoke.
    

**Reward:**

- Defiant Resolve: Gain **1 use of “Divine Defiance”**
    
    - You may **reroll a failed save vs. death, fear, or domination, 1/per long rest**
        
- You emerge from the fire scarred—but whole.
