## Narrative
You walk up to a windswept cliffside plateau, overlooking the eastern sea. Blackened stone stairs spiral upward, carved with worn Draconic text. The air here smells faintly of burnt stone and incense.

At the top rests a half-collapsed shrine built into the rock. A broken dragon statue, once regal, watches over a central stone basin‚Äîthe Altar of Vowfire.

As you approach the summit, the golden scale you recovered from the Grove of Binding begins to glow faintly‚Äîat first a warm flicker, then a steady pulse. The clouds above part slightly, allowing a single beam of sunlight to strike the altar.

#### Pre-Ritual
- As the scale begins to float, Varnok emerges from the shadow of a pillar, almost pained as the light shines from the sun and scale:
    
    > _‚ÄúWhat vow would you carry through fire?  Reveal the promise that binds your spirit. Which among you can stand with your convictions?‚Äù_
    
- Three fiery runes appear on the altar
- Let players **nominate each other** to speak their vows. 

#### Ritual

###### Phase 1
As the players enter the ritual circle, the golden scale floats into the air, glowing like an ember. Suddenly the scale shoots forward plunging itself into the scale shaped slot in the dragon statue. Varnok says:

> _‚ÄúYou must choose 3 among you who must pass judgement before the keepers scale... share your conviction, and prove your worth‚Äù_

Each player must approach the altar and **speak a personal vow aloud**, tied to their past and the growth they now claim. Their words must reflect a defining conviction‚Äîwhether of vengeance, redemption, duty, protection, or transformation.

- Mechanics:

	- **Roll** a DC 13 **Charisma (Persuasion)** or **Wisdom (Insight)** check after declaring the vow.
    
	- If the player **roleplays with emotional depth or resonance**, grant **advantage** on the roll.
    
	- **Teammates may speak first** or offer whispered encouragement to provide the speaker **+1 to their roll** (stackable up to +3).
    
	- If multiple PCs weave their vows together thematically, treat it as a **group check**‚Äîrequiring 2 of 3 to succeed.

	- **Success:**

		- The scale flares like a sunrise. The air warms with golden light.
    
		- The altar accepts the vow, and a ghostly rune of their promise appears in the scorched stone at their feet.
    
		- They may proceed to **Phase 2: Lighting the Vowfire**.
    


	- **Failure:**

		- The vow falters‚Äîthe flame _listens_, but does not yield.
    
		- The scale **lashes out with flame**, forcing a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** or take **2d6 fire damage**.
    
		- The character must either:
    
		    - **Restate their vow** with new clarity,
        
		    - **Accept the help of an ally** who speaks on their behalf, or
        
		    - **Burn something symbolic** (a trinket, weapon, or letter tied to their past) as a sacrifice.

For especially powerful or poetic vows, Varnok may murmur:

> ‚ÄúThat vow has weight‚Ä¶ it may yet echo through the Vault.‚Äù

Grant that player a minor boon - 1d4 temp HP

###### Phase 2: Lighting the Vowfire

The basin of the altar begins to glow, pulsing like a heart. But it remains unlit.

- Actions Players Can Take (pick one per PC):

	-  **Cast or create a fire-based effect** (e.g., _Produce Flame_, _Control Flames_, _Burning Hands_)
    
	- **Place a personal item** into the basin‚Äîsomething tied to a past oath or identity
    
	- **Inscribe a vow** in Draconic or Common into the scorched stone using tools or a blade
    

	- **Skill Challenge:**

		- At least **2/3 of the party** must succeed on appropriate ability checks (DC 13):
    
		    - Arcana or Religion (to direct magical fire)
        
		    - Sleight of Hand or History (to carve the vow)
        
		    - Performance (to speak or chant it aloud)
        

- **Pass Outcome:**

	- The **Vowfire ignites**‚Äîa bright, golden flame bursts into the sky.
    
	- The basin absorbs the players‚Äô vows, and their **names are burned faintly into the stone**.
    

- **Fail Outcome:**

	- The flame **ignites then flickers out**.
    
	- A burning wind erupts‚Äîeach PC makes a **DC 12 Con save** or takes 1 level of exhaustion.
    
	- They must **combine their efforts again** or **sacrifice something valuable** to reignite it.


#### Post-ritual
- **Seed of Renewal:** A tiny seed sprouts in a character‚Äôs palm. If planted during a long rest, it will grow into a small blooming flower or miniature tree by morning‚Äîmarking a personal growth moment.
    
- **Fungus Remnants Puzzle (Optional):** A PC may notice strange fungi that resist the cleansing glow. If investigated, they find a _spore puzzle_ (Arcana/Nature check) hinting that these were _implanted_‚Äîpossibly connecting to an outside corrupting source (perhaps foreshadowing the Heart of Dread).
- A deep roar is felt through the earth as liquid gold drips where the black ichor used to be. Dripping down to the base of the altar filling scale shaped etching. Once filled the scale glows bright with the an image of the next altar sight in its mirrored face. A faint image of Varnok stands among the trees, not speaking, but watching. Etched on the back of the scale is an inscription _‚ÄúSpeak your truth in flame,  And be judged by its light.‚Äù_
