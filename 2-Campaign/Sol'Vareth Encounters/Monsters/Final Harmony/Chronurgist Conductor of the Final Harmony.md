### Description
	A cold and calculating mind honed by time magic, this conductor weaves the threads of destiny to ensure Malachai’s design unfolds. They believe that fate is not a force to follow but one to revise. They keep forbidden chronurgy glyphs etched into the lining of their robes and speak in clockwork phrases. Every step they take has already happened—yet it always ends with the fall of a world unworthy.
