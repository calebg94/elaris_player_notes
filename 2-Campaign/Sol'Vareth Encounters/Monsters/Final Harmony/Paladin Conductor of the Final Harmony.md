### Description
	Sworn to a twisted vow of balance through eradication, the Paladin Conductor is an iron hand cloaked in devotion. Once a holy warrior of light, they now channel radiant energy corrupted by Malachai’s doctrine of “merciful destruction.” To them, cleansing the world is an act of love—one that demands flame, not forgiveness. Their aura inspires dread and awe, reminding others that even faith can fracture.
