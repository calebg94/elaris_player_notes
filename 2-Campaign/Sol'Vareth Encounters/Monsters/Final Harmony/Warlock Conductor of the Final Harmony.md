### Description
	The Warlock Conductor has heard the voice of the **Shard of Malrith** and obeyed. Bound by a pact made not with a being, but with a wound in reality, they channel raw entropy through hexes, illusions, and soul-sapping spells. Their words infect. Their gaze unmoors. They are the cult’s most dangerous secret—because their power is not borrowed... it is _extracted_ from the world’s own scars.
