## Narrative
You walk up to a windswept cliffside plateau, overlooking the eastern sea. Blackened stone stairs spiral upward, carved with worn Draconic text. The air here smells faintly of burnt stone and incense.

At the top rests a half-collapsed shrine built into the rock. A broken dragon statue, once regal, watches over a central stone basin—the Altar of Vowfire.

As you approach the summit, the golden scale you recovered from the Grove of Binding begins to glow faintly—at first a warm flicker, then a steady pulse. The clouds above part slightly, allowing a single beam of sunlight to strike the altar.
