## Overview
Blackstone is a windswept, salt-stained city carved from dark stone along the jagged southeastern coast of Elaris. Once a naval outpost, now a hub of criminal commerce, arcane black markets, and secret loyalties. Blackstone thrives where order frays—run not by kings or clergy, but by a **Trade Tribunal** of merchant-princes, former pirates, and assassins-turned-politicians. Loyalty here is currency, and every coin carries a whisper.

## Notable NPCs
- **Captain Madrik "Bandit" Voel** — Pirate turned privateer, currently serving as a Trade Tribunal enforcer and sometime-captain of illegal missions across the Stormfold Expanse.
- **Madame Elasha Kren** — Mistress of "The Veil’s Lantern" brothel and secret information broker tied to the Final Harmony.
- **Councilor Chrohm Vett** — Leader of the Trade Tribunal, known for harsh justice and secret ties to the Crimson Dominion.
- **Eowyn’s former Guildmaster, Carrik Drench** — Once thought executed, now rumored to rule Blackstone’s docks in shadow.


## Points of Interest
- **The Nailspire** — The Tribunal’s stronghold, a spiraling blackstone tower that watches all trade.
- **Sliver Row** — The poorest and oldest quarter, where Eowyn grew up. Still home to hidden guild activity.
- **The Sunken Rings** — A subterranean system of cisterns and tunnels beneath the harbor, rumored to house forbidden magic and dead gods’ bones.
- **Veil’s Lantern** — A pleasure house with powerful secrets and deadly patrons.

## Valuables
- **Blackstone Coin Marks** — Forged coins embedded with shifting enchantments used to trace trade deals or curses.
- **Krakenhide Leather** — Rare armor sourced from deep-sea leviathans.
- **Sea-Crystals** — Used in enchantment and navigation, found only in Kaelmoor Bay’s reefgrave.

## Internal Relationships

- **The Trade Tribunal** walks a fine line between order and anarchy, constantly negotiating with criminal factions, independent pirate crews, and even remnants of the thieves’ guild.
- **The Veiled Prophets** influence Blackstone through spiritual manipulation and fearmongering, occasionally working with **The Final Harmony**.
- **The Crimson Dominion** exerts influence through economic pressure, demanding order while secretly empowering fanatics.

## Outward Relationships

- **Luminous Compact**: Tense trade ties. Arcane goods flow in, but Blackstone resents Compact surveillance.
- **Veylas Tribes**: Hostile, especially after recent shipwrecks blamed on druidic sabotage.
- **Thalara**: Competing trade city; both cooperate and sabotage each other’s routes across the southern seas.

## Background
Blackstone began as a prison colony and later became a fort during the Crimson Crusades. When the war died, Blackstone was abandoned—only to rise again as a pirate haven. Over time, its raiders grew roots, and today it is a strange mix of drifting loyalty, historic sin, and economic ambition. Yet, its stones whisper of **deeper secrets**, and old shadows stir in the sea’s black mirror.

## Additional Details
> - Rumors tell of **a drowned temple** under the harbor, where the sea still demands tribute.
- Blackstone’s ruling families change with the tide, but all respect the will of the coin.
- **Undercity cults** are reawakening with talk of Malachai’s “Final Harmony.”
- The harbor lanterns never go out—lit by enchanted flame said to be drawn from the heart of a kraken.
