# Passive Perception
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* 

Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's general awareness of its surroundings. The DM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature's Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check bonus. If the creature has [Advantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has [Disadvantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (`10 + 2 + 2`). If that character has [Advantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks, the score becomes 19 (`10 + 2 + 2 + 5`).
