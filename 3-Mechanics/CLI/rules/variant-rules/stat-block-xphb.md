## Attack Notation

The entry for a [monster's](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise.

## Saving Throw Effect Notation

If an effect forces a [saving throw](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md), the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of [saving throw](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md) required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save.

## Damage Notation

A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (`1d4 + 2`) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both.
