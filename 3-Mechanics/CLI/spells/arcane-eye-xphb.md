# Arcane Eye
*4th-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an [Invisible](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has [Darkvision](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 30 feet.

As a [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

**Classes**: [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard (Diviner)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-diviner-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Cleric (Light Domain)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-xphb-light-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
