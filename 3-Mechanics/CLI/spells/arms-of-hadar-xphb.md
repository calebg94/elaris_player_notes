# Arms of Hadar
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/arms-of-hadar.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature in a 10-foot Emanation originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `2d6` Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
