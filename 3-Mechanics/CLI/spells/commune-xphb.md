# Commune
*5th-level, Divination (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), there is a cumulative  chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.

**Classes**: [Cleric](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
