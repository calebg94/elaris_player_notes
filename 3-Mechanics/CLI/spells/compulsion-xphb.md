# Compulsion
*4th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends.

For the duration, you can take a [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each [Charmed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
