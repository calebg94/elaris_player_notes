# Disintegrate
*6th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [Wall of Force](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-force-xphb.md).

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `10d6 + 40` Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [True Resurrection](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-resurrection-xphb.md) or a [Wish](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-Cube portion of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
