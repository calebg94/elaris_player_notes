*2nd-level, Enchantment*

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature you or your companions are fighting automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, a target has a -10 penalty to Wisdom ([Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and Passive [Perception](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) until the spell ends.

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Warlock](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md)
