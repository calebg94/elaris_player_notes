# Feign Death
*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [Blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) conditions, and its [Speed](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0.

The target also has [Resistance](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [Immunity](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Poisoned](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.

**Classes**: [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
