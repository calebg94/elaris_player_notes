# Flame Strike
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` Fire damage and `5d6` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Cleric](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (Light Domain)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-xphb-light-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
