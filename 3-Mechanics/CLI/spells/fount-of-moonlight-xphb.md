# Fount of Moonlight
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [Bright Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have [Resistance](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra `2d6` Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a [Reaction](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [Blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the end of your next turn.

**Classes**: [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Druid (Circle of the Moon)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-moon-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
