# Hex
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the petrified eye of a newt)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` Necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has [Disadvantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) before this spell ends, you can take a [Bonus Action](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) on a later turn to curse a new creature.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [Concentration](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) can last longer with a spell slot of level 2 (up to 4 hours), 3-4 (up to 8 hours), or 5+ (24 hours).
