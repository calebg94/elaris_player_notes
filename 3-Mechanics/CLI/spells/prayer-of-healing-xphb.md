# Prayer of Healing
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) and also regain `2d8` [Hit Points](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [Long Rest](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Cleric](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
