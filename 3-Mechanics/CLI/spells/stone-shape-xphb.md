# Stone Shape
*4th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (soft clay)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or coffer, or you could make a small passage through a wall that is 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
