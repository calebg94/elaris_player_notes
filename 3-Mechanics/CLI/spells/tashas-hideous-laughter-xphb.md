# Tasha's Hideous Laughter
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tart and a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the [Prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) and [Incapacitated](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) conditions for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable of laughter, and it can't end the [Prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition on itself.

At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has [Advantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level about 1.
