# Thunderwave
*1st-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cube)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot Cube originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `2d8` Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the Cube are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 1.
