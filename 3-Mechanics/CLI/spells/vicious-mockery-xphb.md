You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at one creature you can see or hear within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `1d6` Psychic damage and have [Disadvantage](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).
