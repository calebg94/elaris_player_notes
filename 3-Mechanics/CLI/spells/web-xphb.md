# Web
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are [Difficult Terrain](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and the area within them is [Lightly Obscured](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md).

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature [Restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [Restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing `2d4` Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

**Classes**: [Druid (Circle of the Land)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
