# Falling
*Generic Hazard*  

A creature that falls takes `1d6` Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of `20d6`. When the creature lands, it has the [Prone](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its [Reaction](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.
