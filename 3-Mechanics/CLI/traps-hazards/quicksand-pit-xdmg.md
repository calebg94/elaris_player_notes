# Quicksand Pit
*Generic Hazard*  

A quicksand pit is 10 feet deep and covers the ground in a 10-foot square. A creature that enters the area sinks `1d4 + 1` feet into the quicksand and has the [Restrained](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another `1d4` feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check (DC 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand). A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand has [Total Cover](3-Mechanics/CLI/tables/cover-xphb.md) and the [Blinded](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition and risks suffocation.

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by taking an action and succeeding on a Strength ([Athletics](3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check (DC 5 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand).

## At Higher Levels

You can scale this hazard for higher levels by making the pit deeper and increasing the number of feet a creature sinks at the start of each of its turns, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Pit Depth | Sinking Rate |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 5–10 | 15 feet | `1d6` feet |
| 11–16 | 20 feet | `1d8` feet |
| 17–20 | 30 feet | `1d10` feet |
