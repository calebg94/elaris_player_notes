# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
Malachai’s growing following, scattered across Elaris—each cell interpreting his doctrine of “purifying unshaped chaos” in unique ways.

## Etymology
A term coined by Malachai, referring to his belief in ultimate balance through destruction and rebirth.
## Activities
- Recruitment through dreams, visions, and charismatic leaders
- Infiltration of noble houses and temples
- Assassination of "chaos architects"
- Collection of divine or planar relics

## Society
### Beliefs
Cell-based and semi-independent. Each cell is led by a Conductor. The Chorus issues dogma to unify them. The world is malformed and must be undone. Only then can true order be reshaped.
### Culture
Ceremonial silence, glyph tattoos, and harmonic chanting. They use beauty to veil horror.

### Religion
Reveres Malachai as the Worldshaper, a divine visionary touched by the Unshaped Flame.

## Possessions
- Shards of corrupted aether
- Choral masks to unify voice and identity
- Doomsong tomes containing harmonic magic

## History
Formed after Malachai's transformation and disappearance. Cells rose independently but were soon connected through shared visions and coded writings.

## Rumors & Legends
- Their songs can rewrite reality in short bursts.
- Malachai did not disappear—he ascended.
- Sol'Vareth was the first failed attempt at harmony, and the Heart of Dread is his prototype.
