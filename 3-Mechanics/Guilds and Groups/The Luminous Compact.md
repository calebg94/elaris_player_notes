# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
A consortium of merchant princes, arcane engineers, and noble mages united under trade, ambition, and arcane mastery.

## Etymology
Derived from "lumen" (light) and "compact" (binding agreement), referencing their philosophy of enlightenment through arcane order and trade alliances.
## Activities
- Magical research and artifact crafting
- High-level trade negotiations and economic manipulation
- Patent enforcement and magical copyright control
- Arcane transportation infrastructure (portals, airships)

## Society
### Beliefs
Knowledge is progress, and progress must be controlled. Order through innovation is the highest ideal. Rigid, merit-based, and tiered by arcane aptitude and economic value. Bureaucracy is dense and unforgiving.
### Culture
Art is precise, often geometric and magically enhanced. Music and performance are calculated. Status is measured by magical contribution and utility.

### Religion
Agnostic or dismissive of traditional gods. Some venerate abstract forces like "The First Light" or "The Equation Divine."

## Possessions
- Arcane vaults containing forbidden spells
- Gold-bonded contracts that bind by law and magic
- Everlit skylines and spell-automated districts

## History
Formed from three noble houses merging after a magical disaster centuries ago. Grew to power by offering arcane stability in exchange for loyalty.

## Rumors & Legends
- Secretly developed an artificial demigod in a failed experiment.
- Keep a living spell imprisoned beneath Thalara.
- Were the first to erase Sol'Vareth from the world map.
