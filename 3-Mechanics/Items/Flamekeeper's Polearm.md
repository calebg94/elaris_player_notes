# Item Name
*Weapon, Rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Properties**: Fire, Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: 800 GP
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This polished ashwood staff is crowned with a twisted iron cage holding a perpetually smoldering ember. Runes of **Primordial Fire** run along the length, glowing faintly when nature or sacred flame is invoked. It was once wielded by the stewards of Vuremodor’s sacred flame, charged with maintaining balance between wildfire and rebirth.

Warm to the touch, the staff responds not to aggression, but to **purpose**—burning brighter when defending the innocent or cleansing corruption.

**Magical Effects:**
- **Fire Channeling:** On a hit, deal an additional **1d4 fire damage**.
- **Ember Calling:** Once per long rest, you may cast **Flame Blade** or **Create Bonfire** as a **bonus action**, without expending a spell slot.
- **Rekindled Ward:** While holding the staff, if you cast a fire-based spell on your previous turn, you gain **resistance to fire damage** until the end of your next turn.

Flamekeeper's Oath
_“Let fire temper, not consume. Let it warn before it destroys. Let it burn in service of balance.”_
