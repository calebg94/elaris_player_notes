# Item Name
*Weapon, Rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 S
- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: 750GP
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This elegant scimitar is forged of **mirrored steel** and etched with faint **sunburst and lantern motifs** along the blade’s curve. When unsheathed in darkness, it emits a **subtle, silvery gleam**, as if reflecting unseen light. A thin crystal vein runs through its fuller, faintly pulsing with warmth.

The Lanternblade is a relic of **monastic protectors** from Sol'Vareth who believed that knowledge—like flame—should illuminate, not destroy. It was often carried by wandering guardians of balance, lighting both the literal and moral paths forward.

**Magical Effects:**
* **Radiant Insight:** When you reduce a creature to 0 HP, the blade glows with a soft silver light. You gain **advantage on your next Wisdom (Insight)** or **Religion check** made before the end of your next turn.
- **Lantern Light:** Once per long rest, you can use a **bonus action** to activate the Lantern blade’s hidden enchantment. For 10 minutes, the blade emits **dim light in a 30-foot radius**. While this light is active:
    - **Invisible creatures, hidden doors, and magical illusions within 10 feet** are faintly revealed (disadvantage on Stealth or DC 13 Investigation to detect).
- **Gentle Radiance:** While the blade is glowing, you gain **+1 to saving throws against fear**.

_“Its edge is sharp, but its purpose is to illuminate, not sever.”_
