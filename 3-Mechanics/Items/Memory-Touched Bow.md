# Item Name
*Weapon, Rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 P
- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: 650GP
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

Carved from a silvery-gray wood that gleams faintly in moonlight, this bow hums with lingering emotion. Along its limbs are etched tiny runes of **remembrance, sorrow, and clarity**, and its string is woven from preserved strands of hair taken from a loved one—or so the stories claim.

When an arrow is nocked, faint **whispers** echo around the user—ghostlike memories, moments of clarity, or haunting regrets. The bow is believed to be forged in part from **the memory-laced roots of a forgotten tree** in Sol'Vareth, blessed by dream druids and soulbound seers.

It does not only strike the body—it pierces the **mind**.

**Magical Effects:**
* **Weapon Damage:** 1d8 piercing (standard longbow stats; range 150/600 ft.)
- **Whispers of the Past:** Once per turn on a hit, the target takes an additional **1d4 psychic damage** as the arrow reverberates with painful memory.
- **Echo Recall:** Once per long rest, when you miss with an attack or fail a saving throw, you may **reroll the result** as a memory of a past success floods your mind and guides your hand.
- **Resonant Strike:** On a critical hit, the target must succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** or become **frightened** until the end of their next turn, overwhelmed by a vision of their own deepest regret.

 _“Every arrow bears a story. Let yours strike true.”_
