# Item Name
*Item, Wonderous (optional attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Optional Attunement
- **Cost**: 600GP
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This small scale, burnished gold edged in ember-red, is warm to the touch and faintly radiant in dim light. Said to have once belonged to a **defector from the Crimson Dominion**, it represents a spark of conscience preserved in the heart of zealotry.

Legends claim that when a Dominion inquisitor spared a heretic instead of executing them, their flame did not consume—it purified. From that act of defiance, this scale remained, hardened and transformed into a relic of redemption.

Even now, it glows gently when carried by those who offer mercy where others demand punishment.

### **Magical Effects:**
* **Shield of Contrition:** While carrying this item, you gain **resistance to fire damage** **against the first source of fire damage you take each day**.  
- **Flame Reversal:** Once per long rest, when you take fire damage, you may instead **regain HP equal to half the damage taken** (rounded down). The scale cools briefly after use and darkens for an hour.
- **Redeemer’s Boon:** When you **cast a healing spell** or **stabilize a creature**, that creature gains **2 temporary hit points** as a soft light pulses from the scale (this effect can occur once per creature per long rest).

### **Cultural/World Relevance:**

- Carried openly, it marks the bearer as **a flamewalker**, someone who believes even fire can be tamed.  
- In Crimson Dominion territory, **clerics and inquisitors may react with hostility or reverence**, depending on their interpretation of the “Flame’s Will.”  
- It may glow or pulse when **near corrupted fire magic**, or during moments of choice between **mercy and wrath**.

 _“Even fire may be forgiven.”_
