# Item Name
*Item, Wonderous (optional attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Optional Attunement
- **Cost**: 650GP
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A smooth, palm-sized stone engraved with two interlocking rings—**a symbol of trust and kinship** among the ancient monks of Sol’Vareth. When held, the stone hums faintly with warmth, and in quiet moments, those attuned to magic can almost hear **a whispered promise**, echoing from a past life.

The Stone of the Echoing Vow was once passed **monk to monk**, each binding it with an oath of **trust, guardianship, and unity**. It now responds to such bonds with gentle magic, enhancing the strength of those who act in selfless support of their companions.

### **Magical Effects:**
- **Echoing Ally (1/long rest):** As a **bonus action**, you may speak the name of an ally **within 60 feet** that you can see. That creature gains **temporary hit points equal to your level + your Wisdom modifier**.
- **Vow of Guidance:** Once per **short rest**, you may cast the [[guidance-xphb|Guidance]] cantrip from the stone (no concentration required, duration 1 minute), targeting an ally within touch range.
- **Silent Promise:** If you fall unconscious, an ally holding the stone may **use their reaction** to stabilize you automatically without a Medicine check (1/day effect).

### **Cultural/World Relevance:**

- The stone was believed to be one of **twelve vowstones**, created by the early monk-dragons to pass on spiritual promises across generations.

 _“No vow truly ends. It waits, echoing, for the next hand to carry it forward.”_
